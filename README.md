# Phantom

Find the Phantom CAD files (sat,sab,stl,stp) within this document

chose the filetype you need for your simulation software
Warning: some files might reduce the PMMA casing to a simple block

For the simulated phantom: 

PMMA:

rel. Permittivity=3.4

conductivity=0.0043S/m

density=1180kg/m^3

  
Phantom_Solution:

rel. Permittivity=59

conductivity=0.83S/m

density=1058kg/m^3

For the real phantom:

It is built from PMMA and filled with a Water-PVP-Solution
